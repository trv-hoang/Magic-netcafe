HOW TO ADD PRODUCT IMAGES
=========================

1. Find an image for your product (e.g., Google Images).
2. Save or Rename the image file to match the EXACT name of the product in the database.
   - Example: If the product is "Pho Bo", the file must be named "Pho Bo.jpg".
   - Example: If the product is "Sting", the file must be named "Sting.jpg".
3. Ensure the file extension is ".jpg".
   - Currently, the application only looks for .jpg files.
4. Place the file in this folder:
   src/main/resources/images/

5. Restart the application.
